# K-Means Clustering - Task 8

This project implements **K-Means Clustering** for unsupervised learning as part of AI & ML Internship tasks.  
We use datasets like **Customer Segmentation** or **Housing Price Prediction** from Kaggle to demonstrate clustering.

## 📌 Objectives
- Perform clustering using K-Means
- Visualize clusters in 2D
- Use the **Elbow Method** to determine optimal K
- Evaluate clusters using **Silhouette Score**

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python 3
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📂 Dataset
- [Customer Segmentation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)  
- [Housing Price Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harishkumardatalab/housing-price-prediction)

## 📊 Steps
1. Load and preprocess dataset  
2. Apply PCA (optional) for 2D visualization  
3. Fit **K-Means** and assign cluster labels  
4. Use **Elbow Method** to find optimal K  
5. Evaluate with **Silhouette Score**  
6. Visualize clusters  

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python kmeans_clustering.py
```

## 📈 Model Evaluation
- **Inertia (Within-cluster sum of squares)**
- **Elbow Method**
- **Silhouette Score**
