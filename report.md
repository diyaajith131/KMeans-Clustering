# Report: K-Means Clustering

## Introduction
This task demonstrates unsupervised learning using **K-Means clustering**.  
We applied clustering on customer segmentation data and evaluated results using inertia, Elbow Method, and Silhouette Score.

## Methodology
- Preprocessed data with Pandas  
- Visualized dataset  
- Applied KMeans clustering (scikit-learn)  
- Determined number of clusters with **Elbow Method**  
- Evaluated clustering with **Silhouette Score**  

## Results
- Optimal clusters found at k=5  
- Silhouette Score indicated well-separated clusters  
- Visualization showed distinct groups of customers  

## Conclusion
K-Means is effective for segmentation tasks but sensitive to initialization and scaling. Proper evaluation methods like Elbow & Silhouette are essential.
